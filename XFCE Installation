Before you Install Make sure you are on base with no desktop environment
To Install XFCE Run sudo apt install xfce4 -y
then sudo reboot
if theres no lightdm xfce then it says failed to start session I Would Recommend To Change LightDM To SDDM Run Recovery Mode Then root then install with sudo apt install sddm then sudo apt purge lightdm then sudo apt autoremove
If Its Zutty change zutty to konsole gnome terminal xfce terminal other terminal using properties then add konsole then remove the zutty
Change The About Icon Using sudo cp /usr/share/pixmaps/Triaxis-logo.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/xfce4-about.png
Then Refresh the icon cache With sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
Restart XFCE xfce4-session-logout Then Logout And Log Back in Or Reboot Your System
If its still didnt work You Can Do It Later
