When you ask if Triaxis GNU/Linux is lightweight, the answer depends on Desktop Environment,Ram,etc
Legacy BIOS hardware refers to
older computer systems using the traditional Basic Input/Output System for firmware
relying on Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning, and lacking modern features like Secure Boot found in UEFI
requiring specific older OSes or custom setups for compatibility but being phased out for faster
more secure UEFI-based systems. This older hardware is characterized by its reliance on keyboard navigation
slower boot times, and support for drives up to 2TB
contrasting with newer UEFI systems that use GPT and mouse-driven interfaces

Lightweight Desktop Environments
LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment)
LXQt
XFCE (It Is The Only One Lightweight Desktop Environemnt Which Is Official Triaxis Desktop Environment But Not A Default Desktop Environment)
MATE
Enlightenment (E17/E25)
Puppy Linux JWM/Rox combo

Why Its Lightweight
LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment)

RAM: ~250–350 MB idle

Extremely light, modular, and fast. Still beloved for older machines.

Symbol: The Lantern Mask — guiding low-spec survivors through the dark.

LXQt

RAM: ~300–400 MB idle

Successor to LXDE, modern Qt base, still feather-light.

Symbol: The Phoenix Mask — reborn from LXDE’s ashes.

XFCE

RAM: ~400–600 MB idle

Balanced, stable, customizable.

Symbol: The Anchor Mask — steady and reliable.

MATE

RAM: ~600–800 MB idle

Fork of GNOME 2, nostalgic yet efficient.

Symbol: The Heritage Mask — carrying old wisdom forward.

Enlightenment (E17/E25)

RAM: ~300–500 MB idle

Lightweight but stylish, quirky setup.

Symbol: The Mirage Mask — beautiful yet elusive.

Puppy Linux JWM/Rox combo

RAM: ~200–300 MB idle

Minimal DE experience, almost a WM with panels.

Symbol: The Puppy Mask — playful but skeletal.
