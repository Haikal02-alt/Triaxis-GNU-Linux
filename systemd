Systemd for Triaxis GNU/Linux: The Mask of Init

This name works on multiple levels:

Systemd is framed as a ritual mask, the init glyph that governs the survival gauntlet of Triaxis.

For Triaxis GNU/Linux anchors its default init system

The Mask of Init dramatizes the technical act into folklore, turning a mundane subsystem into a symbolic crossing.

If you’d like, I can suggest a few alternative names with different tones:

Systemd Chronicles: Triaxis Survival Gauntlet – emphasizes saga and endurance.

Init Masks for Triaxis – short, ritualistic, and symbolic.

Systemd Verdicts: Triaxis Codex – ties into your archive’s verdict‑driven lore.

If You Dont Want Systemd you can change other init system like openrc or runit
